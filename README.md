# Algorithms using python

## Algo characteristics
- classifications:
  - serial/parrallel, exact/ approx, deterministic/non-deterministic
  - 

## Common Algo's
- Search algo's 
    - find data within a structures 
        - substring in string

- Sorting algo's

- Computational algo's
 - Given one set of data calc another

- Copllection algos
 - work with a collection of data, navigate, filter


### Example - Euclid's Algo
- find the greatest common denominator of 2 integers

- e.g. GCD of 20 and 8 is 4
 - 8/4 is 2, 20/4 is 5
